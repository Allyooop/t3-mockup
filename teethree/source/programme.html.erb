          <h2>What’s changing?</h2>
          <p class="lead">Transformation Through Technology is a transformational change programme centred on improving patient care.</p>
          <p>As a Trust, we are investing £35 million over the next five years in this programme. Transformation Through Technology is significantly changing the way we work and deliver care. With the help of new technology, in future we will have:/p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quicker hospital admission and discharge</li>
            <li>Better assessment and more informed treatment because previous medical records will be available instantly</li>
            <li>Quicker inpatient admission through Advanced Bed Management</li>
            <li>Electronic alerts for allergies and safeguarding issues</li>
            <li>Clinic lists available electronically with patient casenote history</li>
            <li>Electronic prescribing</li>
            <li>More concise appointment letters</li>
            <li>Less repetition of the same questions for the patient</li>
            <li>Quicker diagnosis as immediate patient history available</li>
            <li>Remote access to patient details, particularly for community health staff</li>
            <li>Casenotes available immediately across all sites</li>
            <li>Electronic white boards on wards to aid patient flow</li>
            <li>Single Sign On so you view patient details on 19 different systems with just one password</li>
            <li>Multiple staff able to view casenotes at the same time</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It’s not just about upgrading technology, it’s about completely changing the way we work. This programme will give us the best technology and patient information so we can provide the best patient care. To make this a success, all staff, regardless of their role, are encouraged to get involved and be aware of the changes.</p>
        	<p>The three new systems are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Electronic Patient Record</li>
						<li>Electronic Document Management System</li>
						<li>Clinical Portal</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Go live for the new systems is Autumn 2015 but the opportunities for new ways of working will continue beyond this.</p>

					<h2>Does your computer need upgrading?</h2>
					<p>Some people still have Windows XP computers and these will need to be updated to the New Corporate Desktop in order to access the new technology. Please contact the IT Service Desk on ext:15369 if you haven’t got a New Corporate Desktop computer.</p>
					<p>Computers which have New Corporate Desktop installed will say Windows 7 enterprise when you log on.</p>
					<p> Computers which are still Windows XP and need to be updated will say Windows XP when you click ctrl + alt + delete together at once.</p>
