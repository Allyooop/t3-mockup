          <h2>Title of Article</h2>
          <p class="lead">Something something headline of the news article in question</p>
          <p>We are one of the first hospitals in the country to have a ‘Hospital of the Future’ innovation centre – an ideal environment for staff to come and try out our new technology. The Hospital of the Future is a fully equipped clinical environment which includes our planned clinical information systems, so staff can experience, influence and familiarise themselves with how our business will operate in the future.</p>
          <p>It is a showcase environment which recreates the patient pathway and demonstrates how technology will support the delivery of the three projects - EPR, EDMS and Clinical Portal. Staff are able to see how patient data flows through the system in practice and see the impact of interactions between care professionals and departments along the patient pathway. Some of our testing and staff training will also take place in our new Hospital of the Future.</p>

          <h3>On the lookout for Super Users</h3>
          <p class="lead">Would you be willing to be one of the first people to use our new technology?</p>
          <p>We’re searching for staff to be trained up as Super Users to help with the introduction of the new technology this year. Super Users will get special training to use the Clinical Portal, EPR and EDMS systems before everyone else. They will act as experts in their department to help others, if needed, when we go live.</p>
