          <h3>On the lookout for Champions</h3>
          <p class="lead">Would you be willing to be one of the first people to use our new technology?</p>
          <p>Weâ€™re searching for staff to be trained up as Champions to help with the introduction of the new technology this year. Champions will get special training to use the Clinical Portal, EPR and EDMS systems before everyone else. They will act as experts in their department to help others, if needed, when we go live.</p>
          <p>To find out more, please contact Kathryn Cox, training lead at <a href="mailto:Kathryn.cox@sth.nhs.uk">Kathryn.cox@sth.nhs.uk</a></p>
