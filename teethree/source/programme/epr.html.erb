          <h2>What is an Electronic Patient Record (EPR)?</h2>
          <p class="lead">EPR is a high-tech electronic patient record system which will modernise and improve the way we deliver patient care across the Trust</p>
					<p>Introducing an EPR system will mean all patient information will be available electronically, on screen, at any hospital location, at any time. It will transform the way we admit, treat and discharge our patients. It will improve referral management, reducing the number of cancellations and rescheduled appointments. It is the first step to allow us ultimately to share patient records with other appropriate NHS organisations</p>
					
					<h4>How will it work?</h4>
					<p>In Autumn 2015 we will be introducing state-of-the-art Electronic Patient Record technology which will allow us to create a comprehensive patient record. We will be able to record, view and store all patient information electronically at any hospital or community health location at any time.</p>
					
					<h4>When will it happen?</h4>
					<p>We will go live with the system in Autumn 2015. A robust business case has been approved by the Trust Board and after careful evaluation we have chosen Lorenzo as the system we will use.  We are currently examining all our current data and inputting systems to ensure all the information we store is accurate and valid. This 'validation process' is very important when we move over to the new system.</p>

          <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
					<%= image_tag "touchscreen_laptop_web.jpg", class: "hidden-xs pull-right pad-left", height: "400"  %>
          <p class="lead">Patients deserve and expect the best care. If we are to remain one of the leading NHS hospital trusts in the country, we need to have up-to-date and accurate information about our patients</p>
					<h4>Improving patient care</h4>
					<p>Currently patient information is collected in a number of different ways and using different computer systems. Our systems are limited in what they can do and they canâ€™t always be accessed in all areas of the hospital and community sites. We often have a very disjointed way of collecting and viewing our patient information. The new system will give us a full patient record, available in multiple locations which will improve how we care for our patients.</p>
					<h4>Improving the patient experience</h4>
					<p>By providing clinicians with all the information they need, at all times across the Trust in a single patient record, we will vastly improve the patient experience. Patients will have the confidence that we are working on their care in a joined up way.</p>
					<p>Currently patients often have to give the same information to different members of staff several times or undergo repeated tests because there is no electronic record to access. There can sometimes be delays in accessing paper medical records because they may be being used by a different department or member of staff. Reducing paperwork and repetition will free up staff to spend on direct patient care. </p>
					<p>EPR will provide the most recent and accurate information, enabling faster diagnoses, treatment plans and discharge processes for the patient. </p>
					<p>Treatment plans will be more personalised as the clinician can refer to the patient's journey immediately and share information with other health professionals across the pathway to create a more tailored and effective care package. </p>
        	<ul class="">
						<li>Electronic clinic management which will reduce cancellations, missed appointments and waiting times</li>
						<li>Electronic prescriptions which will help patients get their medications more quickly.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Additional Benefits</h3>

					<p>As well as the previous benefits, moving towards an Electronic Patient Record system will have the following benefits:</p>

          <h3>On the lookout for Super Users</h3>
          <p class="lead">Would you be willing to be one of the first people to use our new technology?</p>
          <p>Weâ€™re searching for staff to be trained up as Super Users to help with the introduction of the new technology this year. Super Users will get special training to use the Clinical Portal, EPR and EDMS systems before everyone else. They will act as experts in their department to help others, if needed, when we go live.</p>
          <p>To find out more, please contact Kathryn Cox, training lead at <a href="mailto:Kathryn.cox@sth.nhs.uk">Kathryn.cox@sth.nhs.uk</a></p>

					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
					<p>If you have any questions, you can contact: ...</p>
					<h4>Has this been done at other hospitals?</h4>
					<p>Yes. Our programme team have visited other hospitals which already use more up-to-date EPR systems. Each system is slightly different as it is adapted for the hospital.</p>
					<h4>How do we know it will work at this Trust?</h4>
					<p>We have held workshops and demonstrations with staff and looked closely at how the systems can be applied to this Trust.</p>
					<h4>How will we train staff to use the new system?</h4>
					<p>The aim is to start training staff over the Spring and Summer of 2015. It will take some time to train all our staff so it's really important that people put time aside to get this training over the next few months. Some staff may also need to update their SMART cards as these need to be correct in order to access the new EPR.</p>
					<h4>Is there a demonstration available to show how the EPR works?</h4>
					<p>Yes, there is a demonstration which describes a patient's journey, called 'William's journey' <a href="../files/williams_story_EPR.pdf" alt="A presentation explaining how an example patient would experience the new system">which can be downloaded here</a>.</p>
					<h4>Is the new EPR system compatibility with the renal proton system?</h4>
					<p>The new EPR system will interface with the current PROTON system in exactly the same way as Patient Centre. With the new Clinical Portal staff will be able to use a single log-on to view all the different departmental systems.</p>
					<h4>Is the Trust going to use electronic prescribing?</h4>
					<p>We are one of nine hospital Trusts evaluating a new electronic inpatient prescribing system which may be implemented as part of our Electronic Patient Record. As part of this assurance process, we have taken part in national testing and evaluation, led by the HSCIC (Health and Social Care Information Centre) which is the national provider of information, data and IT systems across the health and social care sector. A team from the Trust visited University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in August to view the inpatient prescribing system in use on a ward.</p>
					<h4>Will the EPR help support the delivery of the 18 week referral to treatment standard?</h4>
					<p>The EPR incorporates the 18 week pathway recording and detailed work is being undertaken with the supplier of the system to confirm that this will meet the Trust's requirements.</p>
					<h4>Each Clinical Nurse Specialist team has their own mode of documenting patient interactions - in clinic, on ward visits and for telephone calls. What plans are there to incorporate these into the electronic systems?</h4>
					<p>These issues will be worked through over the coming months. Some staff will need to change the way they currently work and there may be more than one option for some of these. A Chief Clinical Information Officer (Nursing) and an Operational Change Manager (Nursing) have been appointed (see the Meet the Team section on this website) to ensure the needs of the nursing workforce are known and incorporated into the programme.</p>
					<h4>We currently ask patients to sign a form to consent to an operation or procedure. How will this be done in future? Will this be done electronically too?</h4>
					<p>The consent process will not change. Consent will be taken in clinic as it happens now. The consent form will be retained with any pathway or pre-op documentation and passed through the pre-op and admissions process where consent will be reconfirmed and acknowledged as per the current practice. Electronic consent is likely to be developed in the future, utilising any number of hand held devices or tablets, combined with electronic forms.</p>
					<h4>Is neonatology going to using the new EPR system?</h4>
					<p>The current JAMIS system will stay. Anything staff currently do in the Patient Centre, they will do in the future in the new EPR system.</p>
